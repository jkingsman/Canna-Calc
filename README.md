# Canna-Calc

PR's and improvements welcome. Start in `index.js` and working your way backwards through components should give you a pretty good picture of how things fit together -- long story short, duplicate a calculator, import it into `calculator_container.jsx`, and make a PR.

Install

```yarn```

Serve for dev (hot reload enabled in dev; check your console output)

```yarn watch```

Dist is an ignored directory and is populated by the CI tool on build, but if you want to make a local bundle etc., this is what you want.

```yarn build```
